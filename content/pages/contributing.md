* Mailing List. Participate in the UtahJS community via our Google Groups <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/utahjs" target="_blank">mailing list.</a>
* Chat room. For quick conversations, join us in #utahjs on freenode.

* Conferences. UtahJS is holding its first annual conference in June 2012. Stay tuned for details!
* Access to O'Reilly books and discounts. Periodically O'Reilly sends books for free, asking only for a public book review. Members also get a 35% discount on all O'Reilly books and e-books.
* Web site. Fork the github repository for the <a href="https://github.com/UtahJS/utahjs.com" target="_blank">utahjs.com web site</a> and add articles, book reviews and how-tos. Send a pull request to get your content added. If you're uncomfortable with git or github, send an email to rpflorence at gmail dot com and he'll either help you figure it out, or simply add the content you'd like to contribute for you.
